# Website Portfolio [Personal Website]

This project is a portfolio website and is intended to describe how I am developing as a Junior Fullstack Developer.

I made this website using Vue JS v.3.x.x, the reason i use VueJS framework compared to other javascript frameworks is that it is very easy to create SPA-based website and the docs that Vue js has is very easy to read and understand. And also for styling, i use TailwindCSS and PrimeVue.
